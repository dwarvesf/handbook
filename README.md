# Dwarves Handbook

Dwarves are a group of software engineers, designers, and innovation advocates. We serve a single purpose: To empower innovations and co-create the next big things.

## Welcome to our Handbook

This handbook offers a quick glance into who we are, how we work, and what we believe. It's for new Dwarves finding their footing, veterans looking to revisit our foundations, and the curious exploring our culture.

When we grew beyond 40 people, we recognized that our "figure it out as you go" approach wasn't serving us well. New team members felt adrift, and institutional knowledge remained locked in conversations rather than documentation.

**So we created this handbook to share what matters.** It covers everything from our values and working practices to vacation policies and office locations. It's both a practical guide and a statement of who we are.

We believe in making the company our best product, which means articulating and refining how we operate. Whatever version you're reading now, it won't be the last. We're committed to keeping it honest, reflecting who we really areâ€”not just who we wish to be.

If you've just joined us, you're in a unique position. You can see things we've become blind to. Question what doesn't make sense. Help us see ourselves more clearly.
