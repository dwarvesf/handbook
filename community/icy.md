## What is ICY? 🧊

ICY is our way of building a borderless software company through web3 technology. Since 2020, we've used ICY to create a culture where every contribution matters. As a community of software engineers, thinkers, and tech enthusiasts, we're constantly exploring and mastering the latest technology together.

Think of ICY as more than just a token, it's your stake in our community's growth. The more you contribute, the more you can earn and benefit from our collective success.

## How ICY works

We believe in recognizing and rewarding valuable contributions. ICY connects community activities with tangible rewards. You can earn ICY through various activities and use it for benefits, including the opportunity to exchange it for Dwarves stock. This system helps us maintain a culture of collaboration and continuous learning.

## Understanding ICY's value

ICY's value is backed by Bitcoin (BTC) in our treasury. This means your ICY's worth moves with Bitcoin's market value. Here's what affects your ICY's value:

- The Bitcoin we hold in our treasury
- How many ICY tokens are in circulation
- Market demand and liquidity

We maintain two liquidity pools, one for ICY and one for BTC. We add Bitcoin monthly at market prices and mint ICY weekly to reward activities. This setup ensures your ICY maintains real value backed by Bitcoin.
