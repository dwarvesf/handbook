## The Dwarves tech radar program

We use a **tech radar** to systematically assess and adopt new technologies. We constantly observe the tech landscape and place promising technologies onto the radar to evaluate their potential.

Our approach is heavily inspired by ThoughtWorks' technology radar, which serves as a visual guide to interesting industry changes and the technologies we've trialed or adopted. The goal is to share our findings and opinions on the technologies relevant to our work.

## How the tech radar works

The radar visually represents our views on various technologies based on their usefulness for our projects. It's structured similarly to the ThoughtWorks radar:

### Quadrants

Technologies are categorized into four areas:

* **Languages & frameworks:** Programming languages, libraries, and frameworks (e.g., Elixir, Svelte, React).
* **Techniques:** Methods and approaches for structuring software or processes (e.g., microservices, Domain-Driven Design).
* **Tools:** Software used in development, deployment, or operations (e.g., Docker, Figma, PostgreSQL).
* **Platforms:** Third-party services or foundations we build upon (e.g., AWS, Kubernetes, Stripe).

### Rings

The rings indicate our adoption stage for a technology, moving from the outer ring inwards:

* **Hold:** Technologies we're watching but aren't actively exploring yet.
* **Assess:** Items worth exploring and researching to understand their potential impact.
* **Trial:** Technologies we consider worth pursuing. We may use these in projects willing to adopt newer tech.
* **Adopt:** Technologies we confidently use in projects when appropriate. We believe these are solid choices for the industry.
