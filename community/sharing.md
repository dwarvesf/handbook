At Dwarves Foundation, sharing is fundamental to our culture. We share frequently through public events, many of which are recorded for wider learning. While sharing extensively might seem unusual, we believe it offers significant benefits.

The primary goal isn't just disseminating information; it's about enhancing the presenter's ability to communicate clearly and deepen their own understanding. Teaching others forces you to solidify your knowledge.

It's common to find skilled programmers who struggle to teach effectively. This often stems from a lack of practice in either teaching or learning from others. When you share, you must articulate your understanding, revealing both strengths and areas needing improvement. Feedback sessions, where others offer constructive criticism, are valuable. They highlight where explanations are unclear and help you strengthen those areas.

This cycle of sharing and feedback is how we collectively learn and grow.

## Sharing guidelines

When preparing to share, keep these guidelines in mind:

* **Scope:** Choose a focused topic rather than something overly broad. This keeps the audience engaged.
* **Time:** Aim for presentations under 60 minutes.
* **Language:** Use English for slides to reach a wider audience.
* **Preparation:** Discuss your topic with a manager or senior team members beforehand. They can offer valuable perspectives.
* **Structure:** A good presentation typically covers:
  * The problem being addressed.
  * How the problem can be solved.
  * The recommended solution or best practice.
  * Key mechanisms, techniques, or relevant code.
  * Pros and cons of the approach.
  * References for further learning.
* **Template:** Please use the official [Dwarves presentation template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14n3DFDkroCTWx3y3GutLc8Ous3RWgza9_gi784tGmMo) for your slides.
