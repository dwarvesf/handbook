## Our approach to compliance

At Dwarves Foundation, we're committed to upholding the highest ethical standards and complying with all laws and regulations. This section outlines our key policies and guidelines to help you understand what we expect from everyone on our team.

## Code of conduct

Our code of conduct defines how we work together as a team. It's simple: treat others with respect, act with integrity, and follow our core values.

### Anti-harassment

We maintain a zero-tolerance policy for harassment of any kind. This includes, but isn't limited to:

- Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, or religion
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
- Harassing photography or recording
- Sustained disruption of talks or other events
- Inappropriate physical contact
- Unwelcome sexual attention

If you experience or witness harassment, please report it immediately to your team lead or Han. All reports will be handled with strict confidentiality and appropriate action will be taken.

### Anti-corruption

Corruption and bribery have no place in our organization. We strictly prohibit:

- Offering or accepting bribes
- Making facilitation payments
- Engaging in activities that create conflicts of interest
- Improperly influencing government officials

All financial transactions must be transparent, accurately recorded, and properly documented.

### Data privacy

We respect the privacy of our team members, clients, and partners. When handling personal data:

- Only collect data that's necessary for business purposes
- Store it securely and limit access to authorized personnel
- Only use data for its intended purpose
- Comply with all applicable privacy laws

If you're uncertain about handling personal data, please consult with your team lead.

## Reporting concerns

If you become aware of any potential violations of our compliance policies, you have a responsibility to speak up. We offer several channels for reporting concerns:

1. Speak directly with your team lead
2. Contact Han
3. Email <ops@d.foundation>

We prohibit retaliation against anyone who reports concerns in good faith. Your identity will be protected to the extent possible, and all reports will be thoroughly investigated.

## Consequences of non-compliance

We take compliance very seriously. Violations of our policies may result in:

- Verbal or written warnings
- Performance improvement plans
- Termination of employment or contract
- Legal action when applicable

The specific consequences will depend on the severity of the violation and will be determined on a case-by-case basis.

## Training and awareness

We believe education is key to maintaining compliance. All team members will receive:

- Initial compliance training during onboarding
- Regular updates on policy changes
- Refresher training annually

Stay engaged with these materials—they're crucial for our collective success and reputation.

## Our commitment to improvement

Our compliance program is continuously evolving. We welcome your feedback on how we can strengthen our approach. If you have suggestions, please share them with your team lead or email <ops@d.foundation>.

Remember, compliance isn't just about following rules—it's about building a culture of integrity that benefits everyone. Each of us plays a vital role in upholding our standards and protecting our reputation.
