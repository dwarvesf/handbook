## You are Dwarves Foundation
Everyone working at Dwarves Foundation represents Dwarves Foundation. When a customer gets a response from Quang on support, Quang is Dwarves Foundation. When a customer reads a tweet by Huy that our systems are upgrading, Huy is Dwarves Foundation. When an engineer talks to you at a meetup, you are Dwarves Foundation. In those situations, all the other stuff we do to cultivate our best image is secondary. What’s right in front of someone in a time of need is what they’ll remember.

That’s what we mean when we say marketing is everyone’s responsibility, and that it pays to spend the time to recognize that. This means avoiding the [bullshit of outage language](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1528-the-bullshit-of-outage-language) and [bending our policies, not just lending your ears](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3513-when-empathy-becomes-insulting). It means taking the time to get the writing right and consider how you’d feel if you were on the other side of the interaction.
It also means that you’re strongly encouraged to help share your thoughts, experiences, and learnings on [Medium](https://medium.com/dwarves-foundation), our blog. 

The vast majority of our customers come from word of mouth and much of that word comes from people in our audience. This is an audience we’ve been educating and entertaining for 5 years and counting, and your voice is part of us now, whether you like it or not. Tell us and our audience what you have to say.
