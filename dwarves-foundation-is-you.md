## You are our voice

When you join Dwarves Foundation, you become our voice to the world. Every interaction matters. When Quang responds to a support request, he isn't just Quang, he is Dwarves Foundation. When Huy tweets about a system upgrade, he isn't just Huy, he is Dwarves Foundation. When you speak to someone at a tech meetup, you aren't just yourself, you are Dwarves Foundation.

In these moments, all our carefully crafted marketing takes a back seat. What people remember is their direct experience with you, a real person representing our team in a time of need or interest.

This is why we say marketing is everyone's responsibility. It means avoiding corporate jargon when explaining outages or technical issues. It means bending policies when the situation calls for empathy, not just offering sympathetic words. It means taking the time to write thoughtfully and considering how you'd feel if you were on the receiving end of your communication.

## Share your voice

We encourage you to share your thoughts, experiences, and expertise on [Memo](https://memo.d.foundation), our blog. Your unique perspective adds depth to our collective voice.

Most of our customers discover us through word of mouth, and much of that comes from people in our audience, a community we've been nurturing for over five years. Your voice is now part of our story, whether you're writing code, designing interfaces, or sharing insights on our blog.

We value what you have to say, and so does our audience. Don't keep your knowledge and experiences to yourself, share them and help us build something greater than the sum of our parts.
