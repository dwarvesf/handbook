# Engineering Ladder

One of the biggest challenges in people management is ensuring that your engineers are growing in their careers. We expect larger companies to have an established career ladder, but it often gets sacrificed at many companies in the name of remaining “flatter” and “more agile”. In fact, there is no such thing as a “flat” organization. Having a “flat” organization is the idea that people don’t spend time talking about or thinking about levels and promotions because there are so many other things to do. However, one of the main reasons people move out is because they experience stagnation in their careers.

We often talk about how to scale our organization, and how to build innovative products but it’s impossible if we cannot retain our talents and have a high standard to look for new joins. For all of those reasons, we wrote [this ladder](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oT2u-cZ4u7ls-V3abmBiddjaZgGTUXBncycxVkyg4Jg/edit#gid=0) to allow software engineering managers to have meaningful conversations with their direct report, around the expectations of each position and how to plan for the next level in their career while maintaining consistency in external recruiting.

## How to read the ladder

We wanted to develop a structure that would allow people to see the big picture and dive into details as needed. Even without knowing all details of one level, it should be easy to develop an idea of area of work and impact that engineers would be focusing on. The ladder consists of five parts:

- **Engineering aspects**: four key outcomes that every engineer should achieve. We wanted to be very clear from the start that the elements must be opinionated, in line with our beliefs that they will reinforce our core values and create a successful organization:

  - **Technical**: focus on technical skills, including an engineer’s mastery, best practices, quality & testing, design, debugging, performance optimization, and scalability.
  - **Execution**: focus on how an engineer gets things done: planning, scoping, estimation skills, getting unstuck, taking ownership, strategic alignment, product/business understanding, and vision.
  - **Influence**: focus on the level of impact and influence on people, including leadership, knowledge sharing, mentoring, hiring, and onboarding.
  - **Collaboration & communication**: focus on teamwork, communication skills, asking for and giving feedback, collaborating, and documentation.

    > We consider **Technical** and **Execution** are “value-adder”, and **Influence** and **Collaboration & communication** are “value-multiplier”. While an “adder” raises the productivity output in their team, a “multiplier” raises the productivity of others on the team. As you progress through to higher levels, the influence, collaboration & communication is significantly more involved.

- **Career path**: give engineers a map of progress. We don’t assume that all engineers should (or want to) aspire to become managers. And leadership is not only for a senior role.
- **Individual contributor track**: outline expectations and examples of engineer’s competencies and responsibilities at every level. While entry levels generally focus on engineers executing work, senior levels focus on mentoring and guiding others in their work.
- **Manager track**: define the detailed matrix for management roles. Everyone following this path should consider himself a “multiplier”, who unlocks the potential in their team. However, we also wanted to emphasize that this is a technical managing role, not a people ops, thus, the need for technical competency is a must.
- **Core values**: remind everyone about the organization's vision, mission, and principles. We expect all members of the engineering team to exhibit [the company values](https://github.com/dwarvesf/playbook/blob/master/engineering/README.md) in their work.
