# Engineering Ladder

This framework allows software engineering managers to have meaningful conversations with their direct reports around the expectations of each position and how to plan for the next level in their career ladder. You can find the spreadsheet version [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oT2u-cZ4u7ls-V3abmBiddjaZgGTUXBncycxVkyg4Jg/edit?usp=sharing).

Whether an engineer is on the IC track or the manager track, their growths will be heavily relied on the four aspects including technical, execution, influence and collaboration/communication.

### Technical

This aspect focus on technical skills, including an engineer’s mastery, best practices, quality & testing, design, debugging, performance optimization and scalablity.

| Maturity level | Description                                                                                     |

| Specialize     | Is the go-to person for one or more technologies and takes initiative to learn new ones.        |
| Evangelize     | Researches, creates proofs of concept and introduces new technologies to the team.              |
| Master         | Has very deep knowledge about the whole technology stack of the system.                         |
| Create         | Designs and creates new technologies that are widely used either by internal or external teams. |

### Execution

This aspect relfects how an engineer gets things done: planning, scoping, estimation skills, getting unstuck, taking ownership, strategic alignment, product/business understanding, and vision.

| Maturity level | Description                                                                                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Enhance        | Successfully pushes new features and bug fixes to improve and extend the system.            |
| Design         | Is the go-to person for one or more technologies and takes initiative to learn new ones.    |
| Own            | Designs and implements medium to large size features while reducing the system’s tech debt. |
| Evolve         | Evolves the architecture to support future requirements and defines its SLAs.               |
| Lead           | Leads the technical excellence of the system and creates plans to mitigate outages.         |

### Influence

This aspect focuses on level of impact and influence on people, including leadership, knowledge sharing, mentoring, hiring, and onboarding.

| Maturity level | Description                                                                          |

| Support        | Proactively supports other team members and helps them to be successful.             |
| Mentor         | Mentors others to accelerate their career-growth and encourages them to participate. |
| Coordinate     | Coordinates team members providing effective feedback and moderating discussions.    |
| Manage         | Manages the team members’ career, expectations, performance and level of happiness.  |

### Collaboration & communication

This aspect emphasizes teamwork, communication skills, asking for and giving feedback, collaborating, and documentation.

| Maturity level | Description                                                                                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sub team       | Seeks to collaborate within a specific part of the team.                                    |
| Team           | Facilitate good communication within the whole team, not just on specific parts of it.      |
| Multiple Teams | Be a confident and efficient collaborator not only in his/her team but also on other teams. |
| Company        | Makes an impact on the whole tech organization.                                             |
| Community      | Well represent the company in the tech community.                                           |

The technical and execution aspect are the "adder" attribues, whereas the influence and collaboration/communication are the "multiplier" attributes. As an engineer advances to a more senior role, the importance gradually shifts to the "multiplier" attributes.
