# FAQ

1. How to pronounce the company name? 
   Dwarf is one of the hardest words to pronounce to the non-English speaker, but that’s what made we special. Checkout [how to pronounce dwarf on YouTube](https://youtu.be/3MJ1_blsY_s)

5. One word to describe Dwarves Foundation?

6. Do we have HR?
   We don’t have the HR department. We aim to build a flat and transparent organization where everything runs around the mission. The Ops team takes care of hiring and training their team members.
   We only have an admin to take care of the paperwork. If you have any question, you can ask your team lead or the admin.

7. Which date will we receive the salary/paycheck/allowance?
   You get the paycheck on the 1st or the 15th of the month depend on your joined day.

8. How about the working hours?
  We care about the quality of the work we produce rather than the number of hours worked. However if you prefer to have a fixed schedule, we recommend to start at 8am and end at 5pm as stated in [Flexible Working Hours](benefits-and-perks.md#flexible-working-hours)

9. How about the dress code? 
   We don’t really have the dress code, but everyone is expected to be well-groomed and wear clean clothing, free of holes, tears, or other signs of wear.
   Clothing with offensive or inappropriate designs or stamps is not allowed. Clothing should not be too revealing.

10. Any interesting projects that we are working on? 
    I suppose you can go to [Fortress](fort.d.foundation) to view all of that information and if you want to join any of them, you can ask the team lead.

11. How about my career path? 
    You can check up the [Making a Career](making-a-career.md) section where we’ve mapped our trajectory of mastery to *six different levels*.
12. What are we heading to this year?
    Planning is guessing. It’s why we don’t really have a business plan. However, we do have an all-hands meeting every two months that you can join and get updated.
13. Can I work on my friend project?
    We have a short note on this topic [Moonlighting](moonlighting.md)
14. Where can I copy the email signature?
    We build a small web app for it: [sign.d.foundation](https://sign.d.foundation)
15. How to raise an issue?
    Depend on the particular circumstances, you can follow the section [Raising an Issue](how-we-work.md#raising-an-issue) or just post a pitch to Basecamp.
    We also have the anonymous feedback form for those who're shy. Check the Woodland HQ message board.
16. My friend who I referred to the company has already completed her probation period and finished her first month with the company. Why have I not received my referral bonus? 
    Our goal is to ensure that projects meet our quality standards. We may ask an engineer to join a project as a supporter at first, in order to learn the ropes under his or her mentor/lead. As soon as the engineer is ready to work on his or her own, we'll convert him or her into a full-time team member and begin charging clients for his or her billable hours.
