## People Ops
### Culture
1. **How to pronounce the company name?** 

   Dwarf is one of the hardest words to pronounce to the non-English speaker, but that’s what made we special. Checkout [how to pronounce dwarf on YouTube](https://youtu.be/3MJ1_blsY_s) 
   **/dwɔːf/** 
   It’s like ‘đ-ô-p’ with a ‘tr’ in between -> /đ-tr-ô-p/

2. **Just in case people don’t get it?** 

    We can give them the alias email **@d.foundation**

   We only have an admin to take care of the paperwork. If you have any question, you can ask your team lead or the admin.

7. **How about the working hours?**

    We care about the quality of the work we produce rather than the number of hours worked. However if you prefer to have a fixed schedule, we recommend to start at 8am and end at 5pm as stated in [Flexible Working Hours](benefits-and-perks.md#flexible-working-hours)

8. **How about the dress code?**

   We don’t really have the dress code, but everyone is expected to be well-groomed and wear clean clothing, free of holes, tears, or other signs of wear.
   Clothing with offensive or inappropriate designs or stamps is not allowed. Clothing should not be too revealing.

[Bao Minh Insurance](https://www.baominh.com.vn/) is a health insurance provided by Bao Minh Company. All employees have a quota for medical check-ups based on specific categories.

    - Passed probation
    - Do not require the company to pay Social Insurance (SI) and Health Insurance (HI).
    - Be one of the core members of the DF team, voted as an outstanding employee of the previous year, or a top contributor to the team's advocacy & learning activities.
        - Note: Some members have SI and HI still receive the Bao Minh insurance card due to needing extra coverage or as a reward for their contributions. These cases are handled individually, and the team may consider publicizing this policy to motivate employees.
3. Starting in 2023, the team switched to using Bao Minh virtual cards for easier use and information storage. 
4. **How will the insurance card be received?** 
    - The Ops team will email the virtual insurance cards to each eligible person.
    - For those who register for their family members, Bao Minh will send the electronic cards to the company email along with the personal card.

    - When visiting a hospital, or clinic during the insurance company's working hours, present the virtual card along with your Citizen Identity Card (CCCD) or National Identity Card (CMND) at the affiliated hospitals.
    - The healthcare facility will check and deduct the medical costs directly from the service bill. Employees only need to pay the difference (if any), and there is no need to submit reimbursement documents for advances.
    - If you visit a hospital, or clinic outside the insurance company's working hours, you will need to pay for the services upfront and then submit the required documentation to the healthcare provider for reimbursement.

## Finance Ops
### Payroll
1. **Which date will we receive the salary/paycheck/allowance?**\
   
   You get the paycheck on the 1st or the 15th of the month depend on your joined day.
   
2. **Can we use another application rather than Wise to receive payroll?**

Yes, you can use other banking services as long as it has USD account details.

3. **What should I do when the payroll date passed for several days, but I didn’t receive a payslip?**

If the payroll date passed for several days and you haven’t received payment, open a support ticket in the Discord channel and the ops team will contact you shortly.

4. **Can I receive payroll in USDT?**

Yes, but we do not encourage you to do it. Because the team’s liquidity is limited, we will approve case by case to support employees receiving the payslip.

## Wise
Wise is a digital banking service that allows users to set up accounts to send and receive funds in different currencies. We use Wise as a salary payment method, therefore, every employee is required to open a Wise account to receive a payslip. 

1. **How to activate Wise balance?**
- Follow the instructions on [Wise.com](http://Wise.com)
- Deposit $20 into your account to activate the balance
- If your bank account or visa card is not accepted by Wise, please open a support ticket, and the team will help you to complete the required deposit.

2. **When will I receive the payslip from Wise?**
Sometimes Wise proceeds transactions randomly to make sure they are clean, so it may take 3-4 days for the payslip to reach your account. If after 7 days from the payroll date you haven't received any notification from Wise, please open a support ticket so then the ops team can investigate further into the matter further.

### Project Ops

#### General
1. **Any interesting projects that we are working on?** 
    I suppose you can go to [Fortress](fort.d.foundation) to view all of that information and if you want to join any of them, you can ask the team lead.

2. **How about my career path?** 
    You can check up the [Making a Career](making-a-career.md) section where we’ve mapped our trajectory of mastery to *six different levels*.

3. **What are we heading to this year?** 
    Planning is guessing. It’s why we don’t really have a business plan. However, we do have an all-hands meeting every two months that you can join and get updated.

4. **Can I work on my friend project?** 
    We have a short note on this topic [Moonlighting](moonlighting.md)

5. **Where can I copy the email signature?** 
    We build a small web app for it: [sign.d.foundation](https://sign.d.foundation)

6. **How to raise an issue?** 
 
    Depend on the particular circumstances, you can follow the section [Raising an Issue](how-we-work.md#raising-an-issue) or just post a pitch to Basecamp.

    We also have the anonymous feedback form for those who're shy. Check the Woodland HQ message board.

#### Project Bonus
Essentially, anyone participating in project consulting will receive a bonus. If certain projects have extra bonuses for the team, there will be an announcement beforehand on a case-by-case basis. Bonuses are calculated and allocated based on the customer's billing.

1. **When will the project bonus be received?**

  Project bonuses are received monthly after the client has paid the bill.

2. **How is it calculated?**
   
  The bonus from the client is evenly distributed among all members participating in the project, including the account manager, project manager (PM), and delivery manager (DM).

3. **What is the responsibility of the Project Lead**
    
    If the lead receives a bonus but other team members do not, it's because the lead has extra responsibilities and a bigger role in the project's success. The lead manages the project, makes key decisions, and ensures goals are met, which justifies the additional pay. The team might review and share the bonus policy for transparency and motivation.
    
4. **What are the criteria for receiving an account/project bonus?**
    
    To receive an account or project bonus, you must:
    
    - Actively participate in the project.
    - Contribute to the project's success.
    - Fulfill specific roles such as account manager, project manager, or delivery manager.
    
    Bonuses are based on your impact on the project and how much you contribute to its goals.

#### Refferal bonus

**My friend who I referred to the company has already completed her probation period and finished her first month with the company. Why have I not received my referral bonus?**
   Our goal is to ensure that projects meet our quality standards. We may ask an engineer to join a project as a supporter at first, in order to learn the ropes under his or her mentor/lead. As soon as the engineer is ready to work on his or her own, we'll convert him or her into a full-time team member and begin charging clients for his or her billable hours. For more information, please check out [How We Hire](https://github.com/dwarvesf/handbook/blob/master/how-we-hire.md#referral).
