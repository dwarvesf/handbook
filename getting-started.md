# Getting Started

## Expectation

Welcome onboard. Getting started at Dwarves Foundation can be overwhelming. Different roles have different expectation. Get to know [who does what](who-does-what.md)  to warm up. There are a lot of little details, a number of big tasks, you’re learning a new job and new coworkers, and you’re likely doing all these things while working remotely. 

Your Dwarves buddy, your Ops buddy, and your manager are all here to help.  There is no set time period for most training periods, but most people are up to speed in about 2 months.

During the first probation period, your primary goals are **Ready for the job** and **get along with your peers.**

#### Be ready for the job

- Your interview is a screening round for us. Every assumption we made will be pulled out for judgment.
- The first 2 weeks could be easy if everything goes well. Your performance will tell.
- The following 6 weeks might be harsh, as we love to have like-minded people around.

#### Get along with your peers

- Learn & adapt to how the team behaves through the Culture Book.
- It’s essential to check out those books: Rework & Remote
- We work remotely. It could be hard to know the others. Be open on the team Campfire so people can know you better.
- We love to discuss the technology, software & design practices, also internet funny kinds of stuff.
- Small talks are okay but don’t do it always.
- Respect is earned, not given. The Dwarves admire the manager of one and who are strong in their fields.

## Your Peers
Usually, when you start a new job in an office, it’s clear who does what. In a remote company, it’s a little less clear. Even when you know [who does what](who-does-what.md), it’s still nice to have a work buddy to ping when you don’t know where to turn. So we set up a [Fortress system](https://fort.dwarves.foundation). 

When you start, you’ll be assigned a buddy. They’ll introduce themselves, and they’re totally willing to point you in the right direction when you need it. Of course, everyone is available to help, but it’s nice to have a dedicated best work friend.

## Setting up your machine
Your buddy helps you with day-to-day questions you might have, but someone on our Ops team will help you set up all the accounts you need to work at Dwarves Foundation. 

Before you start,  your manager will set up a Basecamp dedicated to your on-boarding called "Welcome, [your name]!". When you start, you'll have access to that Basecamp. In it, you'll see to-dos linking to accounts or services that you need to set up -- an 1Password account, 2FA for various accounts, and private wi-fi to name a few. You'll also see things that your Ops buddy or manager need to set up -- Basecamp (obvi), Email, and Gitlab, among a whole list of other things.
