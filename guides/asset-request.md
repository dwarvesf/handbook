Need a piece of gear to get your job done? We've got company assets like books and devices available, and we're happy for you to use them! Here's how the process works for borrowing, returning, and requesting new items.

### Borrowing company assets

Want to borrow something from our library or use a company device? Easy peasy.

We use **Basecamp** for tracking this. Here's how to make a borrow request:

1. Go to the **Woodland** project in Basecamp.
2. Find the **"Request"** To-Do list ([link here](https://3.basecamp.com/4108948/buckets/9403032/todolists/1557155199)).
3. Create a new To-Do using this format:
   > **Your name | Type - Name/Id of the asset | Borrowing date | Returning date**
4. **Important:** Upload a quick photo of the asset when you pick it up.
5. Assign the To-Do to **HR**.

**Example:**

If Huy wants to borrow the book "Start With Why" for a week, his To-Do would look like this:

> **Huy Nguyen | Book - Start With Why | 19/04/2021 | 26/04/2021**

(Plus an uploaded photo of the book)

**Need more time?** No problem. Just update the **Returning date** on the To-Do and add a comment to let HR know.

### Returning company assets

Got the item back? Great! Here's what to do:

1. **Report any issues:** Did you have any problems with the item while you had it? Please add a comment to the Basecamp To-Do detailing any issues.
2. **Return the item:** Bring it back to the office.
3. **Mark the To-Do as done:** Once the item is back safely and in good condition, mark your request To-Do as complete in Basecamp.

We hope you found the asset useful!

### Requesting a new asset purchase

Looking for something specific that we don't currently have? You can absolutely request that the company purchase it! As long as it's reasonable and fits within our budget, we'll do our best to get it for you.

### Making the request

The process is similar to borrowing:

1. Go to the **Woodland** project in Basecamp.
2. Find the **"Asset Requests"** To-Do list.
3. Create a new To-Do like this:
   > **Your name | Item type - Item name/description | Reason for request**
4. Assign the To-Do to **HR**.

**Example:**

> **Huy Nguyen | Book - Start With Why | Note: For further understanding in inspiration**

- **Be specific:** Provide details like the exact name, model, or link if possible.
- **Explain the 'why':** Briefly explain how this item will help you or the team.
- **Budget:** If it's an expensive item that might be over budget, HR might discuss alternative options with you.

### What happens next?

HR takes it from here:

1. **Review:** HR will review the request and the budget.
2. **Approval:** If approved, HR will order the item.
3. **Notification:** You'll get notified via the Basecamp To-Do when the item has arrived and is ready for you.
4. **Completion:** HR will mark the To-Do as done once you have the item.

And that's it! Simple ways to get the tools you need.
