# Asset Request
Company assets equips us to get the job done. We are delighted to know if you can spend your time gnawing our library or using our devices, as long as it follows these protocols. 

### 1. Borrowing
We use Basecamp the team communication tool. Woodland is where public things happen. In the **[Request](https://3.basecamp.com/4108948/buckets/9403032/todolists/1557155199)** list in Todo, create a ticket with this format:

> Your Name | Type - Name/Id of the asset | Borrowing date | Returning date 
and don't forget to upload a picture of the asset for proof. 

e.g.: If Huy wants to spend his weekend with the book Start With Why, he shall create a ticket like this:

> Huy Nguyen | Book - Start With Why | 19/04/2021 | 26/04/2021

and assign HR to handle the request. 

We'll get back by the time of returning date. In the event of extending the borrowing time, please help adjust the timeline and drop an update to the comment section.

### 2. Returning
The Dwarves are required to report any problems experienced with the item during the borrowing period. And most of all, we hope you enjoy using it. You will mark done the ticket once the item is returned in full conditions. 

### 3. Request
In case you look for something outside our current resource, the Dwarves have all right to ask for a purchase of specialized materials. As long as it fits our budget or does not get us bankrupted, we've got you covered. 

**3.1. Requesting**
The requesting process is not much different from the borrowing one, with a reasonable purpose. If the item bypasses our budget, we'd prefer to suggest an alternative option.

and assign HR for approval. 

### 3.2. Processing
HR will handle this part from now on. Once the approval is made, HR will have the item ordered and get you notified when it is ready to use. 

By this stage, HR will also mark done on the ticket to wrap up the process.
