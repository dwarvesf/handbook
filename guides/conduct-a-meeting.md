Meetings are a staple in our work, helping us share info and tackle issues. But let's be honest, they can easily become time-wasters if not run well. To make them productive, we need a clear process that gets straight to the point.

Here are the key things to get right:

### Scheduling & Logistics

Get the basics sorted ahead of time:

- **Give notice:** Announce the meeting time **at least one day** beforehand.
- **Video link:** Create a Google Meet link (or similar).
- **Sync:** Add the meeting to the relevant Basecamp schedule.
- **Notify:** Make sure all participants know about it.

### Clear agenda

Meetings often drift without a clear purpose. A **specific, detailed agenda** prevents wasted time.

- **Host's job:** Clearly state the topic(s) for discussion.
- **Attendee's job:** Come prepared with thoughts and perspectives on the agenda items.

A clear agenda leads to clear outcomes. Simple as that.

### Participant confirmation

We need to know who's coming.

- **RSVP:** Please confirm your attendance (or absence) via the meeting invite **at least three hours** before the start time.
- **Can't make it?** Let the organizer know why, preferably on the same day you receive the invite.

### Meeting notes (Minutes)

Keeping track of what was discussed and decided is crucial. Meeting notes (or minutes) serve as the official record.

- **What they capture:** Decisions made, actions needed, who owns those actions, and deadlines.
- **Who takes them?** Anyone can be designated to take notes (not just a secretary).

**Good meeting notes include:**

- Date, time, and location (or video link)
- Meeting purpose
- List of attendees (and absentees)
- Agenda items discussed
- Decisions reached
- Action items (with owners and due dates)
- Details for any follow-up meeting
