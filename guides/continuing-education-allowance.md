# Continuing Education Allowance
You will always grow by learning and playing with new and cool technologies. From books to conferences, you’ll get a yearly budget for your learning and development goals.

If you’re interested in taking classes that you feel improve you professionally or personally, you have a $300 annual stipend to do so. Some people take courses directly related to their careers while taking photography lessons or learning a musical instrument. It’s up to you; the point is to learn something that you feel enriches you as a person and employee.

This benefit is applied to any full-time Dwarf who has been here for more than 6 months.

The request should follow this format in: Basecamp > Woodland > [Request](https://3.basecamp.com/4108948/buckets/9403032/todolists/1557155199)
