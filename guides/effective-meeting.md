To make working together flexible and productive, especially when we're not all in the same place, we follow a few simple rules for meetings and group work. This helps keep things running smoothly.

### Use the right scheduling tool

Choosing the right tool makes scheduling easier:

- **Internal meetings:** Schedule these on Basecamp within the relevant project or team. Make sure to notify everyone involved. For all-hands meetings, use the main Woodlands Basecamp.
- **External meetings (with clients, etc.):** Use Basecamp as above, but **also send a Google Calendar invite** to include external folks.

### Start on time

Simple but crucial: **Meetings start promptly.**

- If you're leading, it's your job to kick things off on time.
- If you're attending, be ready to join on time.

### Meet during regular hours

We aim for **core meeting hours between 10 am and 4 pm**. Please be available during this window for meetings scheduled **at least 24 hours in advance**.

Need to meet outside these hours? The organizer should schedule it **at least a week ahead**.

### Offer a video option (usually)

Video helps connection, especially with remote team members:

- **Hosting with remote attendees?** Provide a video link (e.g., Google Meet) before the meeting starts.
- **Attending remotely?** Join the video call _before_ the start time. Ensure you have a **quiet space and a solid internet connection**. Joining by phone audio only or from a noisy public place isn't ideal.
- **Voice-only sometimes okay?** Yes, if the organizer decides it's sufficient for that specific meeting.

### Responsibilities in the meeting

Meetings are a team effort:

- **Contribute:** Everyone should feel empowered to share ideas and solutions.
- **Speak up:** If you disagree, raise your point during the meeting so it can be discussed and resolved. Once a decision is made, we all commit to following through. We don't go off-script after agreeing.

### Basics for successful meetings

These are essential, especially for remote collaboration:

- **Good internet:** A fast, reliable connection is key. Remote folks should minimize potential lag.
- **Quiet space:** Find somewhere you can focus and hear clearly. If meeting rooms are limited and you're near others not in the meeting, please respect the ongoing discussion â€“ avoid interrupting or side conversations.

Make sure you have these basics covered if you plan to meet or pair program with teammates.
