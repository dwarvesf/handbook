# Email Communication and Use
We use email as our formal tool for both internal and external communication.
Every email is utilized for a specific field, which comes along with different instructions.

We currently go with these:

## Communication
#### 1. team@d.foundation
For external communication. Clients or people outside the company should only know this email to communicate with us.

Every email composed by team@d.foundation should be meant for external contacts, such as agreement or announcement.

#### 2. operation@d.foundation
For internal communication. Everything happens in the company, the operation email should be in the cc.

operation@d.foundation email is used to

- Inform employee on his/her employment issue (term of employment, salary adjustment, review, meeting)
- Log conversation with clients from other personal team accounts (through cc)
- etc

#### 3. spawn@d.foundation
For hiring. spawn@d.foundation stores every material used for the hiring process, which includes

- Invitation for tests ( Pre-Assessment/ Assignment)
- Receive *DO-NOT-REPLY* notification from CCAT (our resource to assess applicant's competence )
- Confirmation/Reject email for applicants

- Automated receive CV from job sites (IT Viec)

#### 4. accounting@d.foundation
As it sounds, accounting@d.foundation is all for the issue that relates to money transaction.

- Invoice information (in & out)

- Tax

## Use
#### 5. miner@d.foundation
