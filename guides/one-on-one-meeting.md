Strong relationships are core to our culture, and **1-on-1 meetings are how we build them**. Every manager has a 1-on-1 with each direct report, usually weekly or whenever works best for both. This guide explains how we approach 1-on-1s at Dwarves Foundation and offers tips to keep them productive.

## Your first meeting

Think of your first 1-on-1 as **setting the stage**. It's a chance for you and your manager to align on how you'll work together effectively. We like using [Lara Hogan's questions for a first 1-on-1](https://larahogan.me/blog/first-one-on-one-questions/) as a starting point for discussion.

**Important:** When scheduling, make it clear this isn't just a project status update. Some folks might be new to 1-on-1s and appreciate the clarification.

## Agenda, notes, and actions

Productive chats start with a plan. If you're the mentee, **this meeting is primarily for you**, so take the lead on drafting an outline of what you want to discuss. Managers can add items too, but your topics should come first.

**After the meeting:**

* Jot down notes on what you covered.
* List any action items you both committed to.
* Review these notes and actions next time to track progress.

## In the meeting

Focus on **listening and understanding**. If you're the manager, encourage your reports to be open about what's working and what isn't. Create a space where they feel comfortable sharing honestly, rather than telling you what they think you want to hear.

Shift the mindset from a *formal meeting* to a *conversation*. This usually leads to much better outcomes.

## What to discuss

You can cover a lot in a 1-on-1. Here are some common areas:

* **Big picture:** Ask questions about company direction or changes. Understanding the broader context helps you contribute effectively and feel invested.
* **Feedback:** Regular feedback is key to growth. Discuss performance, expectations, and standards. Knowing where you stand helps you improve.
* **Career:** Talk about your growth. Discuss skills you want to build, new areas you'd like to explore, or roles you aspire to.
* **Personal:** Building connection is important. It's okay to chat about non-work things sometimes – a good book, a recent trip – to get to know each other better.

## Time and schedule

Frequency and length can vary.

* **Good default:** Weekly, 30 minutes.
* **Try not to:** Go longer than two weeks between meetings. Relationships need regular connection.

Once scheduled, **treat it as a priority**. Rescheduling occasionally is okay, but cancelling sends the wrong message. **Don't cancel your 1-on-1s.**
