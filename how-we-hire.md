# How we hire
Hiring means we need help. We only hire people who tell us what to do, not the other way around. We always look for long-term teammates that why we want to ensure the new hire is a value fit and culture fit. 

## We hire with goal
That means we seek for teammate who matches our mutual personas: Independent - Teamwork - Problem-solving Mindset - Try hard.

## We hire the manager of one
What’s that mean? A manager of one is someone who comes up with their own goals and executes them. They don’t need heavy direction. They don’t require daily check-ins. They do what a manager would do — set the tone, assign items, determine what needs to get done, etc. — but they do it by themselves and for themselves.
These people free you from oversight. They set their direction. When you leave them alone, they surprise you with how much they’ve gotten done. They don’t need a lot of handholding or supervision.

How can you spot these people? Look at their history. Have they been self-sufficient at previous jobs? Have they defined their role before? Have they started their own site/company before? Or done their own thing in some other way? Find someone with initiative and a budding entrepreneurial spirit. And then nurture it.
You want someone who’s capable of building something from scratch and seeing it through. When you find these people, it frees up the rest of your team to work more and manage less.

## Rounds
Several Dwarves will talk to the candidates to walk them through 5 rounds

### Screen CV
- CV evaluation
- Social Check & Personas Check (via reference & phone screening)
- Based on our current Personas Ratio, we will decide whether or not to move forward

### Pre-assessment
This test is applicable for Fresher and Junior level only. We evaluate the logic, English, and the personalities in a 30-minute online test.

### Assignment
This is currently applicable for Mobile Engineer. This aims to gauge candidates’s skills, problem-solving mindset and further discuss on work-related topics.

### Interview
In a 90-minute interview, the candidates would know more about the Dwarves working style & philosophy, in exchange of their background and skills.

After this step, you will have a meetup with our Technical Recruiter for a brief on benefit package and define a clear expectation from employee’s point of view.

### Roadmap Design
After the candidate has passed their technical test, it’s our job to walk them through the vision we’re following. This helps to ensures whether or not they can fit with us in long-term, and better create an experience during their time with Dwarves Foundation.

## Sideway Program
There are also two other programs that we hold bi-yearly in Spring and Summer.
- The Internship: A 3-month program for students with or without Engineering background from top universities.

- The Apprenticeships: A 6-month paid career development program for people with non-traditional technical backgrounds from underrepresented groups in tech.

Those programs were designed with the purpose to give an opportunity for candidates to experience the real world projects. No coffee runs. We love watching talented people learn and explore their skills.

## Referral
We usually hire and to keep the quality bar, the Dwarves are encouraged to recommend friends that you think they match with the team. We think your suggestions should be helpful as you have to know the person.

We also want to spend the bonus on you rather than the headhunting agency.  Once the referral get successfully converted into a full-time position and deployed to a project, the referrer will receive 2% of the project service fee. 
This bonus is paid upon completion of the project invoice. The referrer must still be employed with the company when the bonus is to be given. 

Let's take this for example:

- A refers B to Dwarves Foundation 
- B works on project C, with a monthly service fee of $5000
- Every time clients finish the monthly invoice for project C, A will receive a referral bonus of $100
