At Dwarves Foundation, we believe in giving you the freedom to work where you're most productive. While we're primarily a remote-first company, we recognize the value of in-person collaboration. Our hybrid working model gives you flexibility while ensuring we maintain our strong team culture.

## Working remotely

Remote work is at the core of our culture. We trust you to manage your time and deliver excellent work, regardless of where you're located. Whether you're at home, a coffee shop, or halfway around the world, we focus on your contributions, not your location.

Some guidelines for successful remote work:

- Maintain a consistent presence on our communication platforms
- Keep your calendar updated with your working hours
- Communicate proactively when you're not available
- Set up a dedicated workspace that allows you to focus

Remember that with remote work comes responsibility. We expect you to be responsive during your working hours and to deliver high-quality work consistently.

## Office presence

While remote work is our default, our offices provide valuable spaces for collaboration, socializing, and building relationships. We encourage you to visit the office when:

- You need dedicated time with your team for collaborative work
- You're onboarding as a new team member
- You want to socialize with colleagues
- You need a change of environment from your usual workspace

Each team determines its own office schedule based on its specific needs. Your team lead will communicate expectations for office attendance, which typically ranges from 1-2 days per week.

## Balancing flexibility and connection

The key to successful hybrid work is finding the right balance between individual flexibility and team cohesion. Here's how we maintain this balance:

- **Team alignment days**: Each team designates specific days when members come to the office together
- **Virtual social events**: Regular online gatherings help remote team members stay connected
- **Quarterly gatherings**: We bring the whole company together at least once per quarter
- **Clear documentation**: We document decisions and discussions to keep everyone in the loop

## Tools for effective hybrid work

To support our hybrid model, we rely on several key tools:

- **Basecamp**: Our primary platform for project management and communication
- **Google Workspace**: For collaborative documents and calendar management
- **Zoom**: For virtual meetings when we can't be together in person
- **Slack**: For quick, real-time communication and social interaction

Make sure you're comfortable with these tools and reach out if you need additional training.

## Measuring success

In a hybrid environment, we measure success by results, not hours spent at a desk. We focus on:

- Meeting project milestones and deadlines
- Quality of work produced
- Collaboration with team members
- Responsiveness during working hours
- Contribution to team culture and knowledge sharing

Your team lead will provide regular feedback on these aspects during your one-on-one meetings.

## Evolving our approach

Our hybrid model continues to evolve as we learn what works best for our team. We welcome your feedback on how we can improve our approach. Share your thoughts with your team lead or during our quarterly surveys.

Remember, the goal of our hybrid model is to give you the flexibility to do your best work while maintaining the connections that make Dwarves Foundation a great place to work.
