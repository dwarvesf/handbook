We have recently moved to [ICY](https://icy.d.foundation/), a token we use to reward writers in our [Discord server](http://discord.gg/dfoundation).

Prior to ICY, we had given out rewards based on what we felt our writers deserved for their work. This page is a more concrete criteria to inform writers the value of their content when contributing to our Brainery.

## Reward criteria

Our monthly budget for rewarding ICY is around **260-300 ICY per month**. _This may change in the future_, especially if we see greater traction and inputs to our Brainery. As such, starting as of December 14, 2022, the criteria to claim ICY for notes are:

### Permanent notes criteria

| Range ICY | Criteria |
| --------- | -------- |
| 7.5 - 10  | The note is above 200 words and is succinctly composed of proper sentences and paragraphs. The note is relatively coherent and may have some visuals or images to better explain the entry.                                                                        |
| 5 - 7.5   | The note is around 200 words or less, containing some sentences, but may be mainly composed of bullet points. The entry is somewhat coherent, but may be obscured due to a lack of written words.                                                                  |
| 0 - 5     | The note is around 200 words or less, containing some or no complete sentences and is mostly composed of bullet points. The entry is mostly in the form of a fleeting note, such that the audience for the summary is more for the writer, rather than the reader. |

### Fleeting notes criteria

| Range ICY | Criteria |
| --------- | -------- |
| 2.5 - 5   | The note is around 200 words or less, containing has some sentences, but may be mainly composed of bullet points. The entry is contextually coherent.                                 |
| 0 - 2.5   | The note is around 100 words or less, containing no complete sentences and is mostly composed of bullet points. The entry is not apparently coherent, and may contain copied phrases. |

### Reward per note

We also have a few great individuals that can output many high-quality notes very easily. We always want to reward users for their content efforts, but we want to make sure that we don't overshadow others and create participation inequality.

To give equal opportunity for users, we have a threshold for the amount of notes submitted to our brainery will drop off as such:

| Range ICY% | Note range relative to # of notes submitted this month |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 100%       | 1st - 2nd note                                         |
| 75%        | 3rd note                                               |
| 50%        | 4th note                                               |
| 25%        | 5th note                                               |
| 10%        | 6th note and thereafter                                |

The **exception** to this criteria is if the submitted note **[links](https://help.obsidian.md/Getting+started/Link+notes) to 2 or more, unique notes of different authors**, such that it is coherent and relevant to the note. This exception will allow you to claim 100% of the ICY as specified in the criteria regardless of how many notes you have submitted.

## Overbudget

Any notes that go above our 260-300 ICY per month will be **carried over to the next month**. This will also help us re-evaluate and update the reward pool in cases of high output of content, if we find it necessary. _This is subject to change in the future._

## Recognition

Check our [[Latest Notes]] to see recent notes, major contributors, and newest contributors to our Brainery. We will regularly update the format, so that we can give active recognition to everyone who participates.
