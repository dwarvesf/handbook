As we said in our recent [post](icy-in-2024.md), today, we're launching the first feature from our 2024 roadmap: an $icy salary advance.

**tl;dr** It's a short-term credit benefit available to all full-time employees in our company.

e.g:

- hnh earn $5000 a month
- hnh can ask for upto `25%` ($1250) of his monthly allowance in advanced
- the credit will be paid automatically by hnh next pay day, plus `0.5% service fee`

## How to use?

- head over to the DMs of the 'Fortress' bot
- type `?salary advance`
- input credit amount in icy.
- done.
