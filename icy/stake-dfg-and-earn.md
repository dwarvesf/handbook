This guide will show you how to use $DFG staking to earn $USDC, cool merch, and more. You'll need a computer with a browser. But first, let's understand why you're doing this:

- $DFG is a token from Dwarves Foundation.
- In the future, Dwarves will give out $DFG tokens.
- You can get $DFG on Ethereum.
- Dwarves made a staking pool on Base.
- Stake your $DFG on Base to get rewards.
- Rewards will be calculated by this formular

Before going to the staking part, please make sure that you have completed these steps:

- Use Coinbase Wallet to store your tokens (Check [this guide](setup-crypto-wallet.md)).
- Get ETH to transfer $DFG from Ethereum to Base with Binance P2P (Follow [this guide](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/p2p/binance-p2p-newbie-guide-7428324997079645557)).
- Withdraw ETH from Binance to your Coinbase Wallet (See [this guide](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/how-to-withdraw-crypto-from-binance-115003670492)).
- Move $DFG from Ethereum to Base network (See [this guide](icy-bridge.md))

The reward will be calculated with the APY is 9.99%/year.

## Withdraw $DFG and claim reward from the staking pool

Now, after a long time locking your DFG and having a decent claimable reward amount, it’s time to withdraw your $DFG and reward from the staking to the staking pool.

1. Go to [Dwarves Foundation Earning](https://tono.gg/dwarves), and log in. Once you’re logged in, if you have staked $DFG, you will see the staked amount in the Total Staked section.
2. Now hit “Unstake” button and choose amount you want to withdraw and hit “Unstake” again.
