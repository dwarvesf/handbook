# Learning
At Dwarves Foundation, we believe that learning is one of the most important aspects of any organization. We also believe in creating a culture that fosters learning and innovation.

We want to demonstrate and encourage individual and organizational learning, where both gaining and sharing knowledge is prioritized, valued, and rewarded. Learning is an ongoing process that never ends in our fast-moving industry. The concept of continued learning at Dwarves Foundation has become synonymous with having a growth mindset â€” a belief in your own ability to change or grow through experience or study.

We want to grow as professionals, so we have built an environment where people feel comfortable asking questions and admitting they don't know everything. We encourage people to seek out opportunities outside of their normal day-to-day work whether that means attending conferences or taking on new projects with other departments within the company.

We also believe that every employee has something to teach others, whether it is through formal instruction or simply by helping others with their work. We are committed to providing the tools, education and training needed for all employees to be successful in their roles. In addition, we organize many events and activities for our people to express their ideas, share their knowledge, and learn with others:

- **Monday's radio talk**: a weekly show where people can share their thoughts on a given topic and hear what others have to say as well.
- **Friday's showcase**: a weekly presentation where people can share what they've been working on lately with the rest of the company.
- **Tech radar**: we've built a Tech Radar to keep up with the latest technology trends, assess their viability for adoption within our company, and then make those decisions accordingly.
- **Brainery**: a collection of learning pieces where we want to build up the 1% improvement habit, learning in public.
