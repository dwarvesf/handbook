# Dwarves Radar Program
The Dwarves have a spinning radar. This radar is how we assess and adopt new technology. Throughout the years, we observe the tech industry and pick out the most promising tech to put into the radar to begin the assessment process.

Our tech radar is highly motivated by ThoughtWork’s vision of the technology radar, which is a visual document of industry changes we find interesting as well as of what tech we have trialed and adopted in our company. The output goal of our tech radar is to create publications on what tech we see in our projects.

## What is the Tech Radar about?
The visual document represents our opinions on tech and what we find useful for our use cases. Similar to ThoughtWork’s vision of the tech radar, our radar program consists of:

### Quadrants
The quadrants consist of:

- **Languages and Frameworks**, e.g., Erlang, Svelte, R
- **Techniques**, e.g., new design technique, software structure, microservices architect.
- **Tools**, e.g., editors, databases, software development tools.
- **Platforms**, e.g., things provided by others that we build software on top like Vault, Istio, JupyterLab.

### Rings
Our radar has four rings, start from the middle.

- **Adopt**: These are technologies we use in our projects when appropriate. They are also tech we believe the industry should strongly adopt.
- **Trial**: These are technologies worth pursuing and may be used in projects that aren’t afraid to bring in new tech.
- **Assess**: These are tech items we believe that are worth exploring and researching on, so that we understand what impact it may have in our company.
- **Hold**: These are technologies in our watch list, but unsure whether it’s worth delving deeper.
