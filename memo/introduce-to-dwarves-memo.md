Every company has a story. We just decide to have more than one.

As the years go by, our stories get piled up. A story of how we build a team from scratch. A story of how we live, how we work, or how we survive the first milestone and get ready for the next chapter.
The purpose of every story is to bring the audience a little closer to the author, to feel related at some kind of level. This is what we do here, to make you understand more about this woodland, in a variety of ways, on a platform called Memo.

## What is Memo

Memo is our medium, takes place as the 3rd tab on our current [Dwarves Website](https://dwarves.foundation/memo/). In other words, it's a blog for team researches, company updates, case studies, podcast transcript. Everything about us, in document form.

## How to Use

The CMS for Memo is [Outline](https://outline.d.foundation/home). The document tree is classified into these categories

* Company: company updates & year-end recaps
* Culture: the culture values, or facts & figures
* Design: blog post & team research of Design
* Engineering: blog post & team research of Engineering
* Podcast: transcript from webinar & interview
* Workflow: short write-up of our working system

### Metadata

A direct parse was conducted from Outline to Memo. Once you hit the 'publish' button on your Outline document, it should be successfully landed on Memo a few secs later. To make sure a blog post can make it, please input these metadata at first  

* spoiler: A brief introduction of the blog content
* tags: keywords that distinguishes your post. If you don't want to make it detailedly, try blog, engineering, design at least
* authors: Use the naming convention of your team email address
* dates: YYYY-MM-DD

A qualified draft for a blog post should appear like this

### **Headlines**

Headlines in Memo should follow the order of Markdown, which is H1 - H2 & H3. For those who haven't gotten familiarized with this:

* H1: put 1 # before your headline
* H2: put 2 ## before your headline
* H3: pit 3 ### before your headline

H3 should be the smallest level of headlines here. Any titles smaller than that can be marked as **bold**, or put it in numeric/ alphabetical order.

Everyone is welcomed to craft their thoughts here. Actually, we encourage you to. Nothing reveals the company voice better than the people who live it.
