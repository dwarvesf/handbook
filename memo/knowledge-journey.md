Our process for evaluating and integrating technology is designed to be thorough yet efficient, ensuring we adopt only the most effective tools into our operations. It consists of four key stages: Assess, Trial, Adopt, and Hold.

- **Assess:** is the initial state where a technology is being evaluated. The objective is to understand the potential and limitations of the technology before committing more resources.
- **Trial:** is where the technology is tested in projects. The objective is to gain hands-on experience and assess the practicality and impact of the technology in a controlled environment.
- **Adopt:** means the technology is proven and recommended for use. The objective is to formalize the use of the technology in our operations and projects, based on successful trials.
- **Hold:** indicates caution or stoppage of use. The objective is to prevent potential risks associated with technologies that are either outdated, no longer effective, or not aligning with our strategic goals.

## Become a Standard in **Playbook**

- **Criteria for Playbook Inclusion**: Once a technology reaches the "Adopt" phase, it undergoes a final evaluation to determine its eligibility for inclusion in our Playbook.
- **Requirements**: For a technology to be considered for the Playbook, it must be successfully applied in at least **two different projects** and receive **approval from all key members of the Labs team**.
- **Purpose**: This thorough vetting process ensures that only the most effective, reliable, and beneficial technologies become part of our core practices.
