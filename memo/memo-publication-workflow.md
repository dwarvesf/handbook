### Choosing the right directory for the right topic

The first thing is to determine the field that you’re writing in. Whether you're interested in writing about blockchain, communication, design, engineering, market, security, or writing there's a directory for you in `playground`.

### Writing your content

- Verify all links in your article by running the repository locally.
- Upload any images to the `assets` folder and reference them accordingly.

### Review process

After writing your article, let a reviewer know if it's a draft or the final version.

- For content: Our experts will review and improve your work. For example, @tom handles engineering, and @nikki focuses on communications.
- For format and design: @anna oversees the visual and structural aspects. Once you're done, take a screenshot, upload it to our server, and ping @anna for her feedback.

### Feedback

Gather all of the feedback, and work on them. For detailed instructions, read the article [Life cycle of a publication](lifecycle-of-a-publication.md).
