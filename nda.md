When you joined Dwarves, you signed some key agreements. Think of them less like paperwork and more like the bedrock of trust between you, the company, and our clients.

We're building cool things together, and that means you'll handle sensitive info about our business, clients, and how we work. Keeping this stuff confidential is crucial â€“ it protects our edge and our reputation. Thanks for taking this seriously.

## What the agreements cover

Let's break down the core promises you've made:

### Non-disclosure agreement (NDA)

This is your commitment to keep confidential information private. This covers a wide range, including client details (like names, project needs, and communications), our business plans (roadmaps, financials), our unique internal processes, and any unreleased products or features.

Heads up: Your NDA obligation doesn't end when you leave Dwarves. Protecting our confidential info is a commitment that continues.

### Non-solicitation

This agreement helps keep our business relationships stable. For 12 months after you leave, it means refraining from recruiting current Dwarves or soliciting our clients for competing work.

### Intellectual property (IP)

Simple rule: Anything you create as part of your job belongs to Dwarves. This includes code, designs, content, ideas, and innovations developed for work. This company IP can't be used for personal side projects or other jobs, even after you leave.

## Your day-to-day responsibilities

### While you're here

Practically, this means taking care with sensitive information. Keep files secure (use passwords!), don't share confidential info inappropriately, and only use company data for legitimate work tasks. If you're ever unsure whether you can share something, please just ask first.

### If you move on

Should you leave Dwarves, you'll need to return all company gear, materials, and files. It's also vital to keep honoring your NDA and non-solicitation commitments. Remember not to use or share our confidential information in your next role, as both your NDA and IP obligations continue.

## The importance of compliance

Ignoring these agreements isn't just a legal headache; it damages the trust we rely on. Violations could lead to serious consequences, including:

- Legal action
- Financial claims for damages
- Court orders to stop certain activities
- Harm to your professional reputation

## Got questions?

These agreements are important, but hopefully straightforward. If anything's unclear:

- Re-read the agreements you signed (HR can send you copies).
- Chat with your manager about specific situations.
- Reach out to HR for clarification on any points.

Thanks for honoring these agreements. Your commitment protects our work, our team, and our future. We trust you to handle these responsibilities with the same care and integrity you bring to your craft every day.
