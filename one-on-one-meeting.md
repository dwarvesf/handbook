# 1 on 1

The strong relationship between managers and employees is the cornerstone of organizational culture. One-on-one meetings are the way to establish these relationships. This page will take you through how we conduct a one-on-one at Dwarves Foundation as well as some tips to keep the meeting productive within your team.

## The first meeting

The first 1:1 meeting is your chance to establish a pattern and standard of how you and your report feel good about the future and how you two want to interact. In [this post](https://larahogan.me/blog/first-one-on-one-questions/), Lara Hogan had a list of questions to ask in an initial 1:1. We borrow those questions to discuss in our first meeting too.

Make sure your report understands 1:1 is not a project update when you send the invite because the employee may have never had 1:1 meetings at their previous job(s).

## Agenda, Notes, and Action Items

In order to have a productive conversation, the key is to come into the meeting with some ideas in mind for what will be in the discussion. Remember it's your direct report meeting so he should be asked to prepare the outline. It's important because it forces him to think about the topics to discuss in advance so the meeting will be more focused and covered. You can contribute items too but your mentee's agenda should always take a front seat to yours.

At the end of the 1:1, you should take notes on what you discussed and add action items for things you both committed to, so that the following meeting you can review them and see how things progressed.

## In the meeting

The purpose of a 1:1 meeting is to listen and clarify. As their managers, you need to encourage them to be super open and honest about what's working and not working. It's crucial to not let your reports make the mistake of telling you what they thought you want to hear instead of what they actually felt.

Also, it's important to change your mindset too, to stop treating a 1:1 meeting as a regular meeting. If you can turn the meetings into casual talk, they will end up yielding much better conversations.

## What to discuss

There is a wide range of topics to be covered in a 1:1 meeting. The following are some good starting points:

- **Big picture:** any questions about the company’s direction and changes. People need to know what's going on at the company so they know best how to contribute and feel invested in the company's success.
- **Feedback:** right feedback will improve the performance of your team. If you want your people to perform well, you have to give feedback to them regularly. It's hard for your reports to follow the right path if they don't know your standards and expectations.
- **Career:** career growth and development is always the top concern of employees. Take the time to bring up any skills your mentee wants to improve on, new things he wants to try, or a new role he aspires to.
- **Personal:** one-one-ones create mutual understanding and connection. It's normal to talk a bit about seemingly irrelevant topics— a new read, a recent trip.

## Time and Schedule

The exact cadence and timing of a 1:1 vary widely by individual but a good default is weekly and a half-hour meeting. Try to not let the gap be longer than 2 weeks. The goal of 1:1s is building relationships, and that's hard to do if you don't speak frequently.

Once the calendar is set, make sure you never cancel a 1:1. It's fine to reschedule sometimes but cancellation is a sign of letting people think you don't value their time. `DO NOT MAKE THE MISTAKE`.

## Caveats

Don't be surprised if you feel like your 1:1 meetings are going nowhere. Chances are your subordinate feels the same way. Generally, people who think 1:1 meetings are a bad idea have been victim to ad hoc, unstructured 1:1 meetings, when those meetings should have been devoted to sharing ideas and work directions, were actually spent on status updates and personal preferences. Watch them out because they are the first warning signs of your failure as a manager.
