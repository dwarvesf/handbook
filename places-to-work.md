## Places to work
### Noise Levels
If you’re doing creative work, research suggests you’ll want to be surrounded by**ambient noise**. A café or co-working space is the perfect choice in this case.
If you need to focus on a specific task, however, you’re going to want silence as [quiet spaces help us focus on straightforward tasks](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/21/how-the-hum-of-a-coffee-shop-can-boost-creativity/) .

In other studies, people has found that exposure to certain colors can play a role as well. Switching the color of your computer’s background screen to blue enhances performance on creative tasks, for example, while making it red helps with detail-oriented tasks. Large, open rooms with high ceilings may also promote creative thinking, they found.
