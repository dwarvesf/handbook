## Where we are heading
We start with purpose. The mankind is here today because of 4 billion years of continuous evolution from a single cell to homo sapiens, through the stone age to bronze, iron, medieval to post-classical and renaissance. The nations and our civilization were built on production, on building. 

Every time we look back at what we are as a race; in the beginning, we feel motivated by what the ancestors have done. There is only one way to honor their legacy and to create the future we want for our own children and grandchildren, and that's to build.

We're on our journey to build an organization that empowers next innovation. The long-term goal is to create an engine for innovation where new ideas happen, we can develop things & bring positive impacts to the world. To achieve that kind of environment, we fully understand it requires a lot of hard work and commitment. Hopefully, doing what we are doing should help bring prosperity, make a meaningful living and enrich humankind.
