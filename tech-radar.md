# Dwarves Radar Program
The Dwarves have a spinning radar. This radar is how we assess and adopt new technology. Throughout the years, we observe the tech industry and pick out the most promising tech to put into the radar to begin the assessment process.

We start this team to empower innovation and join the industry to co-create the future. This urges us to learn the newest and the best technology out there to enhance the output quality, speed up the development process, also to bring the best pieces of software to life.

Everyone is encouraged to gather into small focus groups to discuss and study a particular topic. The below format could be found originated from ThoughtWorks. We organize the topics using two categorizing elements:
- Quadrants represent different kinds of topics. 
- The rings indicate what stage in an adoption lifecycle we think they should be in.

### Quadrants
The quadrants consist of:
- Languages and Frameworks, e.g., Erlang, Svelte, R
- Techniques, e.g., new design technique, software structure, microservices architect.
- Tools, e.g., editors, databases, software development tools.
- Platforms, e.g., things provided by others that we build software on top like Vault, Istio, JupyterLab.

### Rings
Our radar has four rings, start from the middle.
- Adopt: proven and mature for use.
- Trial: ready for use but not completely proven.
- Assess: things to explore, look at closely.
- Hold: things that not fit us or weâ€™ve had a good experience.
