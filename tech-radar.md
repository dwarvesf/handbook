# Radar

## What is Dwarves TechRadar?

The techradar is an activity in the company that happens every 2 months. In this period everyone gathers together into small teams, do research about technologies we found interesting, useful and can help us in our daily works. All the qualified topics will be published as a document by the end of a tech radar.

## Why do we do TechRadar?

When we do our daily work and heavily invest in technology, we live in a bubble. And everything is fine until this bubble collapses. We need a tool to watch Living Technologies outside. So we can adopt new technologies and update our knowledge frequently.

## How do we structure TechRadar?

The Radar is all about tracking interesting things, which we refer to as topics. We organize the topics onto the Radar using two categorizing elements: the quadrants and the rings. The quadrants represent different kinds of topics. The rings indicate what stage in an adoption lifecycle we think they should be in.

## What should be considered a topic?

A topic is a technology or technique that plays a role in software development. topics are things that are ‘in motion’ - that is we find their position in the Radar is changing - usually indicating that we’re finding increasing confidence in them as they move through the rings.

## What are the quadrants?

The quadrants are a categorization of the type of blips:

- Programming Languages and Frameworks. This was just languages but we rolled frameworks into here with the October 2012 Radar.
- Tools. These can be components, such as databases, software development tools, such as versions control systems; or more generic categories of tools, such as the notion of polyglot persistence.

- Platforms. Things that we build software on top of such as mobile technologies like Android, virtual platforms like the JVM, or generic kinds of platforms like hybrid clouds.

- Techniques. These include elements of a software development process, such as experience design; and ways of structuring software, such as microservices.

We don't make a big deal out of the quadrants - they’re really just a way to break up the Radar into topic areas. We don't think it's important which quadrant a blip goes into, unlike the rings - which generate a lot of discussion.

## What are the rings?

The metaphor of a radar says that the closer a blip is to you, the sooner it will be on top of you. Like most metaphors, you can't take it too seriously, but there's an essential sense to it.

Our Radar has four rings, which we'll describe starting from the middle:

- The Adopt ring represents blips that we think you should seriously consider using. We don't say that you should use these for every project; any tool should only be used in an appropriate context. However we do think that a blip in the Adopt ring represents something where there's no doubt that it's proven and mature for use.
- The Trial ring is for blips that we think are ready for use, but not as completely proven as those in the Adopt ring. So for most organizations we think you should use these on a trial basis, to decide whether they should be part of your toolkit. Typically we've used trial blips in production, but we realize that readers are more cautious than us.
- The Assess ring are things to look at closely, but not necessarily trial yet - unless you think they would be a particularly good fit for you. Typically, blips in the Assess ring are things that we think are interesting and worth keeping an eye on.
- The Hold ring is for things that, even though they are accepted in the industry, we haven't had a good experience with. Therefore we are calling them out to warn you that you may run into trouble with them as well. Sometimes this is because we don't think they're mature enough yet; sometimes it means we think they're irredeemably flawed; or just being misused. We do place things in the Hold ring that we wish the industry wouldn't use.
  Unlike the quadrants, we do have some quite passionate arguments about which ring a blip should go into. We don't tend to have angry arguments, but rings are what generate
