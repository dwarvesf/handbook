## Tools & Systems

Besides the customer-facing applications, like the different versions of the website, we have a number of internal systems that help us support, report, and operate the company. They are as follows:

### Basecamp

Basecamp is where daily work happens. We use Basecamp for task tracking and team discussion. Its workflow encourages real productivity and avoids distraction.

### Slack

Slack is the secondary communication tool that we use to collaborate with the customer. The Dwarves will join with the customer team on the Shared Channel.

### 1Password

1Password is where we store the credential to other cloud services. A different group of people has access to particular vaults. Using 1Password help to simplify our workflow and ease our mind by seamlessly integrated into the OS and web browsers.
