# Tools & Systems
Besides the customer-facing applications, like the different versions of the website, we have a number of internal systems that help us support, report, and operate the company. They are as follows:

### 1Password
1Password is where we store the credential to other cloud services.  A different group of people has access to particular vaults. Using 1Password help to simplify our workflow and ease our mind by seamlessly integrated into the OS and web browsers.

### Basecamp
Basecamp is where daily work happens. We use Basecamp for task tracking and team discussion. Its workflow encourages real productivity and avoids distraction.

### Mastodon
Mastodon is an open source social network inspired by Twitter that allows the Dwarves to keep in touch with the alumni network. The platform helps us keep the data safe and ad-free.

### Slack
Slack is the secondary communication tool that we use to collaborate with the customer. The Dwarves will join with the customer team on the Shared Channel.

### Zoho CRM
The sales team adapts Zoho CRM as their primary system to keep track of the deal status and client information. This allows the sales team to tweak and measure its performance independently. All the data can be extracted after that.
