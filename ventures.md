These policies have been part of our approach since our early days. If you joined after 2018, this section will help you understand an important part of how we operate beyond client services.

## Our venture investment model

Beyond our core tech R&D and offshore services for companies, we actively invest in early-stage startups with promising potential. These companies aren't selected at random, they're carefully evaluated by our [Dwarves Ventures](https://dwarves.ventures) investment team.

What makes our approach unique is how we engage: we don't just provide funding, we become the technical backbone of these startups. We step into CTO roles and provide engineering teams, bringing hands-on experience to help these companies navigate their bootstrap phase and secure later rounds of funding.

While the success rate of this model is still emerging, the potential is significant. For Dwarves who become key maintainers of these products, there's an opportunity to receive a small ownership stake in the future or access to discounted ESOP (Employee Stock Ownership Plan) options.

## Building for makers and developers

We're working on several initiatives to build an ecosystem supporting makers and programmers. We're deeply involved with different developer and creator communities, and we've noticed the significant annual growth in development teams and indie studios, creating new opportunities for us to contribute.

Our Superbits team is developing tools and products targeting this market, with plans to commercialize them. When you contribute to these products in your free time, you gain the chance to work on projects you're passionate about while earning ownership stakes in these products.

## Your own side projects

We encourage you to build your own side projects during investment time. If your project shows potential, the team may provide funding for further development. Other team members might join you to help bring the product to market.

Feel free to register your interest in any of these categories, ventures, maker tools, or your own projects.

## A note on product ownership

Building your own products comes with unique challenges. Unlike client work, there's often no pre-defined roadmap or someone to break down tasks for you. You won't have someone coaching you through every step or providing ready solutions when you get stuck.

This is the essence of being a "manager of one", you'll need to define your direction, solve your own problems, and push through obstacles independently. It's challenging work, but the rewards, both in growth and potential ownership, can be substantial.
