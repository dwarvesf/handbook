# What we value
Before anything else, values come first. The value is important to us. They are what we proud of. They help guide us when we are facing a difficult decision. They will be the things you like about what we do at Dwarves Foundation and how we do it.

Our core values guide our strategies and individual actions so that we create a company whose character is as radical as our work. 

- **Craftsmanship**: We work toward perfection in every single piece that we produce. We are proud of the well-crafted software that we develop together.
- **Teamwork**: Teamwork is all about trust and collaboration. Having someone in the team mean we can rely on this person.
- **Sustainable**: We think long-term. We do not believe in rushing for project and working overtime. We believe in working sustainably and balanced so that we are a happy bunch of sane workers. Software requires good brains to create good codes and good processes.

# Culture Code
There is no such specific guide for culture code. So many of these employee handbook projects turn out to be ideal-case prescriptions rather than real-world descriptions. They cover all the ways people should act, not the ways they actually do. That’s a sham. Let’s not write a handbook like that. **Let’s keep it honest.**

We believe the culture is defined by whom we hire, what we promote and encourage. It is dynamic, and it should expand like our business. We welcome its change as long as we still stay on the ground. Just like we want people to contribute new skills and ideas, we want people to contribute to the new culture.

A few things that we observed over the last few years:
- [No asshole rules](https://www.amazon.com/Asshole-Rule-Civilized-Workplace-Surviving/dp/0446698202): no matter how great a candidate may be, being an asshole is an automatic deal breaker.
- False Positives are ok, False Negatives are not: we prefer to not have you in the team rather than let a wrong person affect the others.

## People
#### It's all start with people
Yes, it is. Everything only makes senses with us, the human at the centre of it. 

Everything we want to accomplish starts with our will. 
Any ideas of how to make thing better begin with us.
This company focuses on innovation, and those result only matter if they benefit us.
We are in the centre and are the beginning of everything.

At Dwarves, you are encouraged to contribute your knowledge and value to the team.

#### Team > I

Working in a team is like riding a boat, it requires collaboration. The team need heroes, and there should be an 'I' in the team, but the only way to make the boat go fast is perfect coordination, it also means perfect teamwork and synchronization. The skillset is essential, but it isn't as important as vision and coordination. The 'I' must be unselfish and think about the team first. 

As a team member, it's important to remember that no one is perfect; everyone has something that they could improve upon, including yourself. So, be supportive. Offer constructive criticism. Listen, listen, listen. People who always talk, but never listen will be stunted in growth. Remember that everyone knows something you don't know.

We effectively have an environment in which competition and collaboration co-exist and feed off each other. Competition, synchronization or collaborating perfectly; make the boat go fast is always the main point. Remember, even if you work harder than anyone else, if you lose synchronization, you slow the boat down.
 
#### It's not about you

Everything that happens here is not about anyone in this company. It's not about the CEO, the core team or anyone. They are here because they want to join forces to accomplish the mission of craftsmanship in software engineering. They want to pursue the ultimate goal of empowering innovation.

The Dwarves is more like an idealogy. When we start this company, we think about how cool it is to make the idealogy happens, how cool it is to bring impact to the world and make a meaningful living.

The portion split accordingly. We have rules for the Dwarves who are in that same path, who also want to contribute and make the next products feasible. We work together as a team for a greater good because as soon as it becomes about the individual, things begin to fall apart.

## Work
#### Remote Working
We feel no need to manage your chairs. In other words, we have better things to do than to track you down to every minute. Meetings are for decision making. Ideas and planning should be conducted personally.

But that doesn't mean things can go off the track. Flexible working time can be a double-edged sword. It allows you to start and end thing at whenever you feel like it, which is why we want the Dwarves to know exactly how their day will transpire. What needs to be done. What's left to clean up. 

It doesn't matter if it happens in the kitchen, or on your way to the beach. Work happens when you are ready, and we want you to fully manage it at your own terms. Just make sure you know when things happen and what to do about it. That's all we need. 

#### Around the clock
We care about the quality of the work we produce rather than the number of hours worked. We do not have a specific start time or time to leave the office. 

We work for ourselves and the future of this team. We stay in touch around the clock. The Dwarves are around when you need them. Just don't try to take advantage in a negative way.

#### 70/50

The Dwarvish magic is purely technological know-how. The Dwarves often spend their free-time on hobby projects or new technology research.

The 20% we put more into our work is the extra effort to increase the chance we reach a new height. The total of 120% is our commitment. It's encouraging for most of us and not required.

#### Delegators are dead-weight 
Everybody works. With a small team, you need people who are going to do work, not delegate work. Everyone's got to be producing. No one can be above the work.

That means you need to avoid hiring delegators, those people who love telling others what to do. Delegators are dead weight for a small team. They clog the pipes for others by coming up with busywork. And when they run out of work to assign, they make up more—regardless of whether it needs to be done.

Delegators love to pull people into meetings, too. In fact, meetings are a delegator's best friend. That's where he gets to seem important. Meanwhile, everyone else who attends is pulled away from getting real work done.

#### Effective over productive
Being productive is about occupying your time—filling your schedule to the brim and getting as much done as you can. Being effective is about finding more of your time unoccupied and open for other things besides work. We don't believe in busyness. We believe in effectiveness. Know your priority and do things that matter.

## Engineering Culture
We build a company where software engineering could shine, innovative products are shipped and change the world for the better.

#### Engineering Discipline
Software engineering is an engineering discipline that's applied to the development of software in a systematic approach.

Not applying software engineering methods results in more expensive, less reliable software, and it can be vital in the long term, as the changes come in, the costs will dramatically increase.
 
#### Not a replaceable cog
In every software, the engineering team is one of the most critical factors to make it successful. Software is more of artisanship, and software engineers aren't a replaceable cog.

People have an assembly line mindset leftover from the industrial age. Don't believe the one-size-fits-all interview process with white-boarding problems. These serve to grind away the individuality and make us feel like an assembly line worker.

#### The best idea wins
If you have a great idea and the will to make it work, you can create great changes. Nothing is off-limits — we're constantly looking for improvements in our people, our processes, and our products. All voices are equal here — we hire people to have opinions and perspectives. 

If your idea makes the most sense, that's what we'll do, regardless of your role or seniority.
