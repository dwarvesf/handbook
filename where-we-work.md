# Where we work

### Office
The Dwarves HQ is in Saigon, Vietnam. Fifty-ish people and two cats have desk space in the Saigon office, but those people also work from home regularly. We expand the office space when the old one is full and people want the new office. Anyone is welcome to visit Saigon and work from the office at any time.

### From home
A few people at Dwarves Foundation are based in other countries and they work from home most of the time. Getting the basics right will make a big difference: [a good chair and a good desk](https://medium.com/dwarves-foundation/dfstaythefhome-5e416a4c457c).

### From coffee shops
Working from home all the time isn’t everyone’s cup of coffee. Thus, lots of us choose to work from coffee shops or other third spaces either some of the time or a lot of the time. Great for a buzz of other people and much-needed [caffeine](https://giphy.com/gifs/bobs-burgers-fox-bobs-burgers-tv-3o72F3CQSLwU7XTlDy) of course, but please do mind our [basic security rules](security-rules.md) and procedures to ensure that nothing leaks on to the cafe wifi.

### From a coworking space
If working from home or from a coffee shop doesn’t suit you, then trying a coworking space might just do the trick. We support a $50/month stipend towards a desk in such a place.

There are a few [places](places-to-work.md) that we usually visit.
