Knowing who to bring a question or issue to should be straightforward. Most things fall within the focus of a specific group or "chair" at Dwarves Foundation. While the people mentioned here are good starting points, remember everyone at Dwarves is approachable and happy to point you in the right direction. If you have a question, ask it â€“ chances are you're not the first.

## Our expectations

We define clear expectations for each role. If you're qualified for the job, we trust you know what needs doing. We expect everyone to take ownership of their responsibilities and actively work towards our shared goals.

## Going beyond your role

Meeting expectations is the baseline, but we encourage everyone to go further. We love seeing Dwarves push the boundaries of their roles and even take on responsibilities that might traditionally fall elsewhere. When we notice people stepping up, we actively look for ways to support their growth, whether through new activities or adjusted roles.

We foster a culture where you feel empowered in your role and comfortable exploring new directions as you grow.

## Our structure: the leading chairs

Instead of rigid departments, we organize ourselves around key delivery areas or "chairs." This helps us focus on impact and adapt as needed. Here are our main chairs:

### Partnership

This chair focuses on building and maintaining strong relationships with our clients and partners. It covers aspects like understanding client needs, ensuring project alignment, and exploring new growth opportunities. **Han** and **Minh** are key contacts here.

### Delivery

The delivery chair is all about crafting and shipping high-quality products and technical solutions. **Huy N** helps manage our delivery efforts. This includes:

* **Product strategy & design:** Defining product direction and ensuring intuitive, well-designed user experiences. **Anna** contributes significantly to our design efforts.
* **Engineering:** Building robust backend systems, APIs, web frontends, and mobile/desktop applications. **Thanh P** helps guide our web engineering efforts.
* **Infrastructure:** Ensuring our systems and our clients' infrastructure are reliable, scalable, and secure. **Quang** helps lead our infrastructure operations (SRE).
* **Quality assurance:** Rigorously testing our work to catch issues before they reach users.

### Learning

Continuous learning is core to our craft. This chair ensures we keep growing our skills and sharing knowledge effectively, whether through internal initiatives, documentation, or exploring new technologies. **Tom** heads up our research efforts within this area.

### Communication

This chair focuses on how we tell our story, both internally and externally. It involves sharing updates, maintaining our public presence (like our website and publications), and ensuring clear, transparent communication across the board.

### Engagement

The Engagement chair works to make Dwarves Foundation an excellent place to work. This includes supporting our team's well-being, fostering a positive culture, managing people operations, and helping individuals navigate their career paths and growth within the company. **Huy N** plays a key role here, bridging operations and engineering perspectives, and is often a great first point of contact if you're unsure who to talk to about workplace or career questions.

## Executive leadership

### CEO

**Han** is our CEO and founder. He sets the overall direction for Dwarves Foundation, guides our strategy, and helps ensure we have the right people to achieve our vision.
