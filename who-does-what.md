# Who does what
Figuring out whom to bring a particular issue or question to shouldn’t be a guessing game. Most concerns fall pretty clearly within the responsibility of a specific team at Dwarves Foundation, and the head of that team should be the first point of contact. At the same time, every single person who works at Dwarves Foundation is approachable and friendly, more than willing to point you in the right direction. If you have a question, you’re probably not the first, so speak up!

## Expectation
Expectations are the responsibility defined for each role. If you are qualified for the job, we don’t have to tell you what to do. We expect someone in a particular role to ensure the responsible or be actively working towards them.

## Beyond a role
The expectations define the bar for the role, but what about going above and beyond? We would love everyone in the company to go above and beyond these expectations. In fact we pretty much expect everyone in the company to be meeting them and then asking us what more they can do to help.
When we see people pushing the limits of their current role, and **when we see people already fulfilling other roles** we will jump on this as soon as we notice to **offer up extra activities** or even a new role.
We want to foster a culture where everybody feels empowered to do their role and as they feel comfortable and ready to push in any direction they wish.

Below you’ll find a list of the major groups and teams within the company. They’re listed in alphabetical order by group name first and then, when relevant, by team. Inside groups/teams, people are in listed alphabetical order by last name, and the most senior people in a group/team are shown in bold.

### Business & Marketing
The business development group is lead by **Linh** and responsible for every aspect of growth. The business group consists of three teams:

#### Account
The account team responsible for taking care of the clients. When the sales bring back some deals, the account will help to close it, runs the project and ensure its success. **Giang T** is a person you could speak.

#### Sales
Under **Linh** leadership, **Nam**, **Duy N** is working closely and responsible for all the partnership inquiry from our customers. They also help to expand the business connection.

#### Marketing & PR
We don't have marketing department. No one is taking responsibility for marketing. We are still looking for the right person for the job. At the meantime, **Duy** occasionally spend her time to tell our story and keep the Dwarves public-facing channels updated.

### Design
The design group is lead by Khai and consists of 2 teams:

#### UX Designer
**Ngoc**, **Ly** and **Thanh** heads up product strategy and works on new features of every product that we build at Dwarves Foundation. They look for insights into customer behavior using a variety of methods and play a key role in helping inform product direction and how we work.

### Executive
We have one C-level executive at Dwarves Foundation.

#### CEO
Han is our CEO. He’s principally responsible for setting the overall direction of the company. He was the founder who started Dwarves Ventures, the ventures builder that led to Dwarves Foundation, back in 2014. As the company keeps growing, he also helps to recruit and fills up the missing pieces.

### Operation
#### People Ops
**Van** is our person for HR development. Under the collaboration between Van & Huy N, hopefully every dwarf can match our standard and happily achieve their goals. Van is also an admin assistant. She is another great person to ping if you don’t know where to go with a question.

#### Technical Ops
**Khai** is taking the probation to lead the Design team and to look after the design folks. **Huy N** can be looked as the bridge between operation team and engineer team. Along with Khai, Huy will work with Han to make working at Dwarves Foundation an excellent experience for its employees. Huy is often the best person to tap first, when you don’t know whom to talk to about a problem in your career path, mission.

### Programming

#### Mobile & Desktop
Working on the native applications for Android, iOS, and MacOS, the mobile team is lead by **Trung** and is responsible for those user-facing systems. That was only possible because we dedicated solid teams to both efforts. **Phuc** and **Khanh** is also a critical part of the mobile development team.

#### QA
Before we ship a new feature, **Quynh**, our resident bug squashers. Their job is to break things, so we know what needs fixing. They run rolling tests on all web and mobile versions for quality control. Few things ship without their stamp of quality approval.

Keeping the lights on with high reliability is the foremost mission of the Infras operations team or SRE, and they're op-fully amazing at doing it. **Quang** is team lead and he works with **Nam N** to make sure our infrastructure stays healthy.
