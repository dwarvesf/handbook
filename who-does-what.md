# Who does what

We all know things get clearer if you have it appeared through visual example. How about giving this chart a chance? 
Dwarves Foundation's Organization Chart: https://org.d.foundation/

Figuring out whom to bring a particular issue or question to shouldn’t be a guessing game. Most concerns fall pretty clearly within the responsibility of a specific team at Dwarves Foundation, and the head of that team should be the first point of contact. At the same time, every single person who works at Dwarves Foundation is approachable and friendly, more than willing to point you in the right direction. If you have a question, you’re probably not the first, so speak up!

## Expectation
Expectations are the responsibility defined for each role. If you are qualified for the job, we don’t have to tell you what to do. We expect someone in a particular role to ensure the responsible or be actively working towards them.

## Beyond a role
The expectations define the bar for the role, but what about going above and beyond? We would love everyone in the company to go above and beyond these expectations. In fact we pretty much expect everyone in the company to be meeting them and then asking us what more they can do to help.
When we see people pushing the limits of their current role, and **when we see people already fulfilling other roles** we will jump on this as soon as we notice to **offer up extra activities** or even a new role.
We want to foster a culture where everybody feels empowered to do their role and as they feel comfortable and ready to push in any direction they wish.
